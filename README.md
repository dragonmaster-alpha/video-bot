# reddits-finest

A Node.js bot to automate the making of reddit thread videos.

This bot uses the reddit API to get the top posts from the r/AskReddit thread,
Google Cloud Platform's text to voice functionality and ffmpeg(ubuntu) to edit the videos.

The bot is capable of making the hole video just from the user selecting a thread on the menu.

Some videos made by this bot can be found on [This dummy channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MR4V9dmncLnYCFTIz_4Kg/featured)

You can compare them with the videos found on [This 300k subs channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SkyOnFir3)
